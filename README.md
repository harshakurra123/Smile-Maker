# Smile-Maker
### Proposal for smile maker application
- Smile maker application is an entertainment app, in which user can browse the jokes. Home page shows joke after every refresh. If user wants list of jokes, we provide button on home page to direct to list of jokes. 
- Authentication is required for user to post or edit the content in the joke.
- Application is developed in python with Django framework using postgresql as database.
- Application uses Restful apiâ€™s for serving the data.
